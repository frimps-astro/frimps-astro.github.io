# Introduction
Recognizing groups that possess similar features in a network is termed Community detection and such groups can be called communities. If an individual belongs to one and only one community, then we can say the communities do not overlap. In graph networks, nodes can be grouped according to the common features they share and a node belonging to one community could have a feature that can make it belong to another community. In that case, communities detected in the network would overlap i.e. a node may belong to more than one community. In the paper under evaluation, the focus is on non-overlapping communities.
